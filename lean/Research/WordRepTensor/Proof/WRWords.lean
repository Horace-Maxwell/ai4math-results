# Words: prefix counts and the chord lemma

Part of the proof of the frozen statements of `Research/WordRepTensor/Challenge.lean`
(written by Claude while Codex was out of quota, 2026-09-28).

For distinct letters `x`, `y` of a word `w`, alternation (the frozen `Alternate`) is
characterised by prefix counts: if the first of the two letters to occur is `x`, then every
prefix `w.take j` contains at least as many `x` as `y` and at most one more; conversely, this
bound on all prefixes implies alternation. From this we get the *chord lemma*: in a word that
represents `G`, if `a ~ c ~ d ~ b` is a path, `a ~ b`, and the first occurrences of `a, c, d, b`
appear in this order, then `a ~ d` and `c ~ b`.
